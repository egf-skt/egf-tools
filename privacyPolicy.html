    <h1>Privacy Policy for eGangotri Foundation Tools (egf-tools)</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <span id="lastUpdated"></span></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>eGangotri Foundation</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information
      when you use our <strong>eGangotri Foundation Tools (egf-tools)</strong> application (the "Service").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect different types of information when you use our Service:</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Information You Provide Directly</strong> — When you use our Service, you may provide or authorize access to certain information.
      If you enable modules that integrate with Google Drive (e.g., Bulk AI Renaming), we may access limited information from your Google account
      necessary for that module’s functionality, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Google Account ID (to identify you within the Service)</li>
      <li>Your display name (to personalize your experience)</li>
      <li>Your email address (for communication, if necessary)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Google Drive Data (Files Metadata)</strong> — If you use the Google Drive renaming module, the Service may need to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read file names and IDs</li>
      <li>Modify (rename) file names</li>
      <li>Access files you own or that are shared with you with "Edit" access</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>We do not collect, store, or transmit the content of your Google Drive files.</em> We only interact with file metadata (specifically, names and IDs)
      as needed to fulfill your explicit requests within the application.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Data</strong> — We may collect information about how you access and use the Service, such as IP address, browser type/version,
      pages visited, timestamps, device identifiers, and diagnostic data, for improving the Service and troubleshooting.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the Service</li>
      <li>To notify you about changes to the Service</li>
      <li>To enable interactive features you choose to use</li>
      <li>To provide customer support</li>
      <li>To monitor Service usage and performance</li>
      <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues</li>
      <li>Specifically, to rename files in your Google Drive as per your explicit instructions (when that module is enabled)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your Personally Identifiable Information or Google Drive data to outside parties.
      This does not include trusted third parties who assist in operating the Service, conducting business, or serving you, provided they agree to keep information confidential.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With Your Consent</strong>: We may disclose your information for any purpose with your consent.</li>
      <li><strong>For Legal Reasons</strong>: We may disclose your information where required by law or subpoena, or if we believe such action is necessary to comply with law, reasonable law enforcement requests, or to protect the security or integrity of the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us. While no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure,
      we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data and operational metadata, including secure configuration,
      network access controls (e.g., MongoDB Atlas access lists), and least-privilege credentials.</p>

    <h2>5. Retention of Data</h2>
    <p>We retain Personal Data only as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and to comply with legal obligations,
      resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Operational logs may be rotated or archived per institutional policy; descriptive collection
      data remains under your institution’s control.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights such as access, rectification, deletion, objection, restriction, portability,
      and the right to withdraw consent. To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information below.</p>

    <h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>The Service may contain links to third-party sites. We are not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or practices.
      Please review the privacy policy of every site you visit.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      If you believe a child has provided us personal data, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the new Policy on this page and update the “Last updated” date above.
      Please review this Policy periodically for changes. Changes are effective when posted on this page.</p>
